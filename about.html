            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2010, Sarah and Michael Chen took a leap of faith. After a decade working in corporate publishing—she as an editor, he in sales—they'd grown weary of watching independent bookstores close while chain retailers treated books as interchangeable widgets. They believed there had to be another way.</p>
            <p>With their savings, a small business loan, and more optimism than perhaps was wise, they signed a lease on a narrow storefront on Main Street. The previous tenant had been a hardware store, and for the first month, the Chens found themselves pulling nails from the walls and scrubbing decades of grime from the floors.</p>
            <p>They opened on September 15, 2010, with 2,000 books, a secondhand espresso machine, and a hand-painted sign that Sarah's mother had made. That first day, they sold exactly eleven books. Sarah still remembers each title.</p>

          <div class="about-text">
            <h2>Growing With the Community</h2>
            <p>Word spread slowly at first, then faster. The Book Nook became known for its thoughtful recommendations, its cozy atmosphere, and its willingness to special-order any book a customer wanted. When a beloved local professor started bringing her literature classes in for tours, enrollment in those classes mysteriously increased.</p>
            <p>By 2015, we'd outgrown our original space. We expanded into the adjacent storefront, doubling our square footage and adding a proper café, a children's corner with a reading loft, and a dedicated event space that could seat fifty people for author readings.</p>
            <p>The pandemic years were challenging—like every small business, we had to adapt. We launched curbside pickup, virtual book clubs, and a "Blind Date with a Book" program that became unexpectedly popular. We survived, and our community supported us in ways we'll never forget.</p>
            <p>Today, The Book Nook carries over 10,000 titles across every genre. We host six regular book clubs, weekly story times, monthly author events, and an annual literary festival that draws readers from across the region. We've come a long way from eleven books on opening day.</p>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>What We Believe</h2>
          <p>The principles that guide everything we do</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Books Are for Everyone</h3>
            <p>We believe that reading is a fundamental joy that belongs to all people, regardless of age, background, or experience. Our staff is trained to welcome first-time readers and lifelong bibliophiles with equal enthusiasm. We stock books in multiple languages, maintain an accessible store layout, and offer a "pay what you can" shelf for those facing financial hardship.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Curation Over Algorithm</h3>
            <p>In an age of personalized recommendations generated by machines, we believe in the irreplaceable value of human connection. Every book on our shelves has been read and loved by someone on our team. When you ask for a recommendation, you're getting the benefit of a real reader's experience—someone who can ask questions, pick up on your hesitations, and find the unexpected gem that an algorithm would never suggest.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Community is Everything</h3>
            <p>A bookstore should be more than a place to buy books. It should be a gathering place, a "third space" between home and work where ideas are exchanged, friendships form, and the community comes together. We host over 200 events per year, from author readings to poetry slams to children's craft afternoons, because we believe books are meant to be shared.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Support Local, Think Global</h3>
            <p>We're proud to be a locally owned business that keeps money in our community. We source our coffee from a local roaster, our pastries from a neighborhood bakery, and we partner with local schools, libraries, and nonprofits. At the same time, we believe books connect us to the wider world. We actively stock translated works, international authors, and diverse perspectives that broaden horizons.</p>
