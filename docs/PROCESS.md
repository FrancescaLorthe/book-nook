I added a free shipping progress bar to my bookstore project. The bar updates dynamically as users add books to their cart. Once a user adds four books, the UI displays the message “You’ve unlocked free shipping!” and the progress bar visually reflects that milestone. I think the feature fits the store well because it adds a realistic ecommerce incentive and makes the cart feel more interactive.
Using micro-iteration in Claude Code felt structured and low stress. I worked one step at a time instead of prompting everything at once. While it may have been slightly slower, it helped me understand exactly what was changing in the code. I liked that Claude clearly broke down its logic and explained updates. That made the process feel manageable and prevented me from feeling overwhelmed.
During development, there was a small issue where the cart navigation button was missing on pages outside of the books page. After explaining the issue clearly, Claude helped me identify the routing problem and fix it quickly. Nothing major broke during the process, which made the workflow feel smooth.
I used a mix of Claude Code and VS Code. Claude was helpful for reasoning and structured iteration, while VS Code felt more controlled for reviewing files directly. I would use this workflow again for features involving state logic or UI behavior. For small styling tweaks, I would likely skip the full micro-iteration process. Overall, this approach felt organized and effective.
